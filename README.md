## About

This repository contains the source code of the Digital Green Certificates App Core for iOS.

The app core provides shared functionality for the [verifier](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-ios) and [wallet](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-wallet-app-ios) apps.

## Translators 💬

You can help the localization of this project by making contributions to the [/Localization folder](Localization/SwiftDGC).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- You need a Mac to run Xcode.
- Xcode 12.5+ is used for our builds. The OS requirement is macOS 11.0+.
- To install development apps on physical iPhones, you need an Apple Developer account.

### Build

Since this is just a requirement module, it is used as a dependency in both the verifier and wallet apps on iOS.
For that, Xcode builds the module from source in the target app. Because of that, building this module on its own is not supported.
